Join me and tonnes of great speakers on May 7th!
It's all online and you can get tickets at [jsvid.com](https://jsvidcon.com)

Food waste is one of the biggest environmental and social challenges facing the planet. OLIO helps people connect and share surplus food. And it's built in React Native! In my presentation I will talk about how we migrated the entire OLIO application to React Native over a period of 3 months with a front-end team of just 3 developers. I will talk about some of the issues we faced as an inexperienced React team (performance issues, code structure, testing, etc), how we overcame these and how our lessons could help the you.
