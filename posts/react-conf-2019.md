# Using React Native to save the world

Back in October I had the amazing opportunity to speak at the [React Conf 2019](https://conf.reactjs.org) about how we at OLIO are using React Native to save the world.

Food waste is one of the biggest environmental and social challenges facing the planet. OLIO helps people connect and share surplus food. And it's built in React Native! During my presentation I talked about how we migrated the entire OLIO application to React Native over a period of 3 months with a front-end team of just 3 developers. I talked about some of the issues we faced as an inexperienced React team (performance issues, code structure, testing, etc), how we overcame these and how our lessons could help the audience

You can check the full talk on Youtube:
