**TL;DR**: Our team rebuilt the Olio app in React Native in just 3 months. In this talk, I walk through how we approached the migration, the performance and testing issues we hit, and the lessons that can help other teams planning a similar move.

In October 2019 I spoke at [React Conf](https://conf.reactjs.org) about how our small team migrated the Olio app to React Native in three months, what went well, and what we would do differently today.

Food waste is one of the biggest environmental and social challenges facing the planet. Olio helps people connect and share surplus food - and it runs on React Native.

During the talk I cover how we planned the migration, the trade-offs we made to move quickly, and how we tackled performance, architecture, and testing along the way.

## Key takeaways

- We migrated the production Olio app to React Native with a very small team.
- The biggest issues we faced were performance, testing, and finding the right architecture boundaries.
- The lessons from this migration have helped other teams planning similar React Native upgrades.
