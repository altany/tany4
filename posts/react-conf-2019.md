In October of 2019 I had the amazing opportunity to speak at the [React Conf 2019](https://conf.reactjs.org) about [how we at OLIO are using React Native to save the world](https://conf.reactjs.org/event.html?_Tany_).

Food waste is one of the biggest environmental and social challenges facing the planet. OLIO helps people connect and share surplus food.

And it's built in React Native!

During my presentation I talked about how we migrated the entire OLIO application to React Native over a period of 3 months with a front-end team of just 3 developers. I talked about some of the issues we faced as an inexperienced React team (performance issues, code structure, testing, etc), how we overcame these and how our lessons could help others.
